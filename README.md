## Welcome to Mordoria
This is the state of the game (after one small bug fix) at the end of the 24x7
tower stream.  ThePrimeagen, Teej, and others are going to continue to work on
this game (and already have been) and will continue to add to it.

This is the initial commit, many more to come.

## What to expect
In the next couple of weeks I'll announce on YT, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, and
update the README here with more information on how we will distribute updates
to this game.

## WARNING
This is in the shape of a game, and I can even possibly see a fun game in here,
but its still very rough.  This is early development and should be understood
that way.  If the game breaks, sorry :)
